# Healthcare Readmission Prediction Project

This project is an end-to-end pipeline for predicting 30-day patient readmissions using a challenging healthcare dataset. It includes data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluationâ€”all organized into modular Python scripts. The project supports both local (pandas) and distributed (PySpark) processing and can be easily customized for different datasets.
